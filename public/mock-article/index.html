          <p>Just two weeks ago Corona virus was… now the globe is in lockdown....</p>
          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has now reached X cases, spread to x countries, and caused X fatalities.</p>
          <div data-mount id="scrollytellerNAMEonePRESETinitial"></div>
          <p>
            Just like in this chart, there's a lot going on, and it's very hard to try to understand what it all means.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, we're here to help — this story aims to help you understand how quickly coronavirus is spreading in
            different countries, where Australia fits into the global picture, and what we can learn from countries that
            appear to have curbed the rise of COVID-19.
          </p>
          <div data-mount id="mark"></div>
          <p>
            To start, one concept that is vitally important to understanding a pandemic is exponential growth. This is a
            pattern viruses like coronavirus tend to follow, due to the way they're spread.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result is that what might seem like small differences in the rate of growth of the virus can actually
            have enormous impacts on how many people are infected overall. Let's look at how.
          </p>
          <div data-mount id="mark"></div>
          <p>
            One good way to think about the exponential spread of coronavirus is to look at how long it takes for the
            number of cases in a country to double.
          </p>
          <div data-mount id="markPRESETdoublinginit"></div>
          <p>
            Let's look at three different scenarios — one in which the number of cases doubles every two days, one where
            cases double every three days, and one where cases double once every week.
          </p>
          <div data-mount id="markPRESETdoublingweek1"></div>
          <p>Initially, the differences might look small.</p>
          <div data-mount id="markPRESETdoublingweek2"></div>
          <p>But as the numbers grow the differences increase dramatically.</p>
          <div data-mount id="markPRESETdoublingmonth"></div>
          <p>Within a month, the differences are stark — and remember this example started from just one case.</p>
          <p>
            It's for this reason that early intervention can have a huge impact on the overall number of infections. If
            you can slow the spread early in the outbreak, it has a huge impact later on.
          </p>
          <div data-mount id="mark"></div>
          <h2>How coronavirus has spread around the world</h2>
          <div data-mount id="markPRESETchina"></div>
          <p>What does that look like in the real world? Let's look first at the source of the outbreak, China.</p>
          <div data-mount id="mark"></div>
          <p>
            As you can see, in China the virus initially spread exponentially, but it now appears the country has
            reduced that growth significantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll look at what measures China took to do that a little later, but first let's look again at what's
            happening everywhere else in the world.
          </p>
          <div data-mount id="markPRESETall"></div>
          <p>
            What this chart shows us is that a number of countries are showing rapid growth in known coronavirus cases.
            However, because the outbreaks started at different points in time, it's difficult to compare exactly how,
            say, Australia's growth rate compares to China's in the early days of its outbreak.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to realise though, that these represent the confirmed cases, those people who have been
            tested. The actual number of cases in each country is likely to be higher, depending on how much testing
            they are doing.
          </p>
          <p>So, let's do two things to help make this a bit easier to understand.</p>
          <div data-mount id="mark"></div>
          <div data-mount id="markPRESETkey"></div>
          <p>
            Firstly, let's narrow it down to a few key countries so we can make it a little easier to read — [LIST
            PLACES IN A COLOUR-CODED WAY] China, Australia, Italy, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, United Kingdom and
            United States.
          </p>
          <div data-mount id="markPRESEThundred"></div>
          <p>
            And now, let's change it so that we start tracking cases day-by-day from the moment when each country had
            100 cases, instead of by the exact date. This brings them all into roughly the same timeline.
          </p>
          <div data-mount id="markPRESETlogarithmic"></div>
          <p>
            But it's still a little hard to compare the early days of each outbreak, because they're all so compressed
            down near the bottom of the chart. To aid with this, we're going to change the vertical axis of the chart to
            a logarithmic scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that instead of rising in a linear fashion, it is scaled by powers of 10. 10x 10 is 1000, x 10 is
            10,000, times 10 is 100,000 and so on. This is a particularly useful way to view coronavirus cases because
            the virus itself spreads exponentially rather than in a linear fashion.
          </p>
          <div data-mount id="mark"></div>
          <p>
            It's a little hard to wrap your head around, but here's another way to think about it. If a country's cases
            are growing exponentially, it'll appear on this chart as a straight line headed up and to the right.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can see that some countries, like Italy and China, the line goes up steeply early on. Their case numbers
            grew very quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Singapore and Japan though, the line is flatter. The case numbers grew much more slowly. That's the
            "flattening the curve" goal everyone has been talking about.
          </p>
          <div data-mount id="markPRESETtrends"></div>
          <p>The angle of each line tells you just how fast it's growing.</p>
          <p>MAYBE WE NEED A LITTLE MORE EXPLANATION HERE?</p>
          <div data-mount id="mark"></div>
          <p>[REMOVE TREND LINES] and [CHANGE Y AXIS SO THAT IT CUTS OFF AT 30,000 CASES. TRUNCATE X AXIS TO MATCH]</p>
          <p>
            So now we can compare countries, let's zoom into the especially important time when the virus first takes
            off.
          </p>
          <div data-mount id="markPRESETlowtrend"></div>
          <p>
            What we want to see as much as possible are lower trend lines for each country — more like Singapore and the
            latter part of South Korea's trajectory, and less like Italy.
          </p>
          <div data-mount id="mark"></div>
          <p><strong>[HIGHLIGHT ITALY TREND LINE]</strong></p>
          <p>
            If the rate that people are being infected is slower, that means fewer people are seriously ill at the same
            time, and that puts less pressure on hospitals, allowing them to better care for the people who really need
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of COVID-19, older people are most at risk and typically require the most care. But if health
            care systems are overwhelmed, as in Italy, doctors may need to prioritise who they are even able to treat.
          </p>
          <p>[HIGHLIGHT AUSTRALIA TREND LINE]</p>
          <p>
            As you can see Australia is still in the early stages of the outbreak. While it's growth rate is not as
            sharp as Italy's, the number of cases here is still double every X days, and we're growing fast than
            countries like Singapore and Taiwan at the same stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            If that growth rate were maintained, Australia would have 1,921 cases in one week's time and 8,235 cases in
            a month.
          </p>
          <p>
            The World Health Organisation estimates the global death rate from coronavirus is at least one per cent.
          </p>
          <p>So that means 82 Australians will have died from coronavirus in a month.</p>
          <p>
            However, if Australia can manage to put in place measures to significantly shift the current growth rate of
            coronavirus, those numbers could be much lower.
          </p>
          <h2>What's worked to flatten the curve?</h2>
          <p>
            There are a range of different ways other countries have attempted to curb the spread of coronavirus. Some
            of the key options are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Test lots of people for COVID-19</li>
            <li>Limit or impose checks on travellers coming into the country</li>
            <li>Trace all the people who have been in contact with confirmed cases</li>

            Let's start with Singapore, a country of 5.8 million people, which currently has 313 cases of coronavirus
            and no deaths, *** MISSING TEXT? ***
          </p>
          <p>
            Singapore reported its first case of coronavirus on January 24, just one day before Australia's first case.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, like many Asian countries, it had learned important lessons from past epidemics — in Singapore's
            case that was the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003.
          </p>
          <p>
            By January 27, it had implemented thermal scanning of all people arriving at Changi International Airport.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strict quarantine on anyone who had been in Hubei followed, and on February 1, they barred all visitors who
            had been in China in the last 14 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            On February 17, when there were 75 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the government issued a ‘stay-at-home'
            notice to everyone who had been in China in the previous two weeks.
          </p>
          <p>To date, Singapore has not closed schools, though school holidays started on March 14.</p>

            into contact with the virus.

          <p>
            "A couple times a day, you'll get an SMS and you have to click on a link that will show where your phone
            is," Mr Fisher explains. "In case you cheat and leave your phone at home with someone else, the government
            has people knocking on doors now and then. The penalties are pretty harsh."

          <p>
            On February 26, two people were charged under the new Infectious Disease Act of giving false information and
            obstructing contact tracing.

            These measures may seem to only be possible in an authoritarian-leaning island-state like Singapore, but
            many of the same measures and mindsets were put in place in Taiwan, a country that at 23 million people is
            similar in size to Australia.
          </p>
          <p>[BRING TAIWAN INTO CHART AND HIGHLIGHT]</p>
          <p>
            With more than 1 million Taiwanese working in China, and 2.7 million Chinese visiting Taiwan every year, the
            country knew containing coronavirus infections was going to be a challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Taiwan, its response also came out of its failings in dealing with the SARS outbreak in 2003, which
            killed 73 people.
          </p>
          <div data-mount id="markPRESETtaiwan"></div>
          <p>
            This time around, Taiwan enacted an early ban on Chinese visitors and was able to make use of more than
            1,000 negative pressure rooms in hospitals, dozens of additional disease control doctors and infectious
            disease labs that can host viral testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            That planning meant they could test 2,400 people a day, with more capacity still available in the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Taiwan linked its immigration and health insurance databases to spot people with a higher risk of infection.
            It tested people with respiratory disease who came up negative for influenza, which helped uncover the first
            infections and prevent community spread.
          </p>
          <p>As of today, Taiwan has 100 cases and one death from the coronavirus.</p>
          <p>
            Now, you may be thinking that there are already 568 cases in Australia, so what hope do we have of
            containing it now. But staying in Asia, South Korea's response could hold some salient lessons for
            Australia.

          <p>[Chart highlights South Korea line]</p>
          <p>
            Like Singapore and Taiwan, South Korea's response was informed by shortcomings in fighting a previous
            disease, in this case MERS, which
            <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/25-october-2015-mers-korea/en/">claimed 36 lives in 2015</a>.

            Before the country had any confirmed cases, quarantine and screening measures were in place for arrivals
            from Wuhan from January 3.

          <p>The first case was reported on January 20.</p>

            Professor Allen Cheng, an infectious diseases specialist at Monash University tweeted that "South Korea has
            had a model response despite early setbacks."
          </p>
          <p>
            Lots of testing was the key in South Korea. It created a network
            <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51836898">of 96 public testing labs</a> and began testing
            nearly 20,000 people a day, including at drive-through testing stations.
          </p>
          <p>
            South Korea has tested more people than many other countries — more than

            While it has among the highest confirmed cases in the world, these measures appear to be working, and the
            death toll from the virus stands at 84. The rate of growth has also slowed, indicating the measures it has
            implemented can work to significantly change the trajectory of the spread even once the virus establishes a
            presence in the country.

          <p>
            With countries in Asia appearing to be doing a better job in slowing the spread of the virus, the epicentre
            of the outbreak has shifted to Europe, where the most new cases are now being reported.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the early stages of the outbreak Italy and South Korea were on a similar trajectory, however the impact
            on each country has been drastically different.

          <div data-mount id="markPRESETkoreatoitaly"></div>
          <p>So why has Italy's health system been so overwhelmed, and why have so many more people died in Italy?</p>
          <p>
            Italy reported its first coronavirus cases, two of them, on January 31, after the first case was reported in
            Australia, and two weeks after the first case in South Korea.

              >Then on February 21</a
            >, the first death from the coronavirus was reported and Italy announced a cluster of 15 cases in the
            Lombardy region, which would become known as the ‘Italian Wuhan'.
          </p>
          <p>By March 1, the number had exploded to 1128 cases.</p>
          <p>
            It is too early to be certain of why cases spread uncontrolled in Italy. A number of reasons have been
            touted.
          </p>
          <p>
            One is that the virus was
            <a href="http://https://www.wired.co.uk/article/coronavirus-italy" target="_blank" title=""
              >circulating unnoticed in Italy</a
            >, possibly from the middle of January, because the infected people had no symptoms or only mild symptoms.
          </p>
          <div data-mount id="markPRESETitaly"></div>
          <p>Hassan Vally, associate professor of public health at LaTrobe University, says Italy was slow to react.</p>
          <p>
            "As soon as you have uncontrolled spread that is occurring before you're doing anything to limit the spread,
            you get this exponential growth in cases," he said. "They were late to the party."
          </p>
          <p>
            An <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/coronavirus-italy">Italian health researcher</a> noted that
            there were an unusually high number of pneumonia cases in January. Unlike in Taiwan, they weren't tested for
            coronavirus.
          </p>
          <p>So what can be learned from Italy?</p>
          <p>
            From the start the country's social distance messaging was muddled, with regional politicians downplaying
            the need for it, and ignored by many Italians.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763401">research shows</a> that the virus
            is disproportionately affecting older populations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The death rate among Italians with coronavirus aged 80 and above has been around 20 per cent, and 12 per
            cent for those aged 70-79. Those two groups account for nearly 90 per cent of Italy's deaths.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's
            <a
              href="http://http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51"

              title=""
              >the same as in China</a
            >
            for 80 and over, but in those aged 60 to 79, the rate was even higher - 30 per cent.
          </p>
          <p>The Japan mystery</p>
          <p>
            So if elderly people are most at risk is there a way to focus just on them? This is what Japan has done,
            with measures to isolate the eldery. Like Italy, Japan has a larger older population, with 26% of people
            above 65, however it has not experienced the same soaring cases and fatalities.
          </p>
          <div data-mount id="markPRESETitalytojapan"></div>
          <p>
            Initially experts had put Japan's lower trajectory down to the fact it was not testing as many patients, but
            the lower death rates indicates Japan's elderly population are taking calls to isolate themselves seriously.

            If our regional neighbours are examples of what we should be aiming for, in the coming weeks the United

            While the government was issuing public health notices about large gatherings, hand washing and other

          </p>
          <p>
            Donald Trump, after initially downplaying the threat of the virus, abruptly changed tack, and a massive
            effort is underway to increase the amount of testing.
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>So what can we take from this?</p>
          <p>
            Firstly even though countries have acted differently, it's those that have moved first that have best been
            able to control the impact of the virus.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Australia's trajectory sits above countries like Singapore, there is evidence that some early
            decisions the Government made, like restricting arrivals from China helped to delay the spread of the virus
            en masse. [SOURCE IS HEALTH REPORT]
          </p>
          <p>
            This means we still have an opportunity to bend that curve earlier. So should we be locking down the country
            like China did in Wuhan province, or as Italy is attempting to do now?
          </p>
          <p>According to Professor Vally, not yet.</p>
          <p>
            "I think the situation in Australia is nowhere near what was happening in China. The whole point was that in
            China they were very late to it and they had to take extreme measures to bring it under control.
          </p>
          <p>
            "We're still doing OK and that's why the government is taking a staged approach. They are taking measures as
            they feel are needed, based on where we are right now."
          </p>
          <p>
            In a sign that the advice to the population to undertake social distancing has not worked, the Government is
            now implementing more draconian measures.
          </p>
          <p>
            That staged approach now means that all non-essential shops and businesses in NSW and Victoria are closed.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the Government has stopped short of an outright lockdown, which prevents people from leaving the house
            for any non-essential reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            What about closing schools - a measure in Australia that has become a fracture point in opinions on how the
            Government is handling the situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Victorian Government has now moved to close schools early ahead of the first term break and NSW has
            encouraged parents not to send their kids to school unless they need to because they have to go to work.
          </p>
          <p>
            On this front Professor Vally agrees with the Government that such a measure is really disruptive, and
            should be avoided if possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Singapore was successful without closing schools. That says you can have success in limiting the outbreak
            and spread of disease without closing schools.

          <p>
            "The only other thing I can say is that it's a really big and difficult decision to close schools. There are
            huge knock-on effects on the children's education, on parents who have to take time off from work, and maybe
            on the health workforce, because some of those parents are going to be part of the health system."
          </p>
          <p>
            What the Government does have control over is how rigorously they test and trace the contacts of those who
            test positive.
          </p>
          <p>
            To date, Australia has done
            <a
              href="http://https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/doorstop-interview-in-melbourne-about-coronavirus-covid-19"
              target="_blank"
              title=""
              >115,000 tests for the coronavirus</a
            >. Health Minister Greg Hunt says Australia is testing at one of the highest rates in the world. But
            currently only those people who have been in contact with a confirmed case of COVID 19, or are displaying
            significant symptoms are being tested.
          </p>
          <p>
            "The answer to this epidemic in Australia is social distancing and the rapid contact tracing and isolation
            of cases. Mass testing of contacts is going to be important so that we identify all cases, including those
            with mild and no symptoms, who may be spreading illness," Professor Vally said.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other thing is we must continue to track how the countries that have successfully halted the spread are
            doing. While flattening the curve is an elegant concept, reality is likely to be messier.
          </p>
          <p>
            China has begun the process of awakening the country from lockdown, but with no vaccine or effective
            treatment, the risk of a second wave of infections is high, as only a small fraction of the population is
            now immune to COVID 19, nowhere near enough to slow the spread. And in recent days Singapore has seen a
            spate of new infections.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we can learn anything from the outbreak so far it's there is no one measure that will solve this, and
            there isn't going to be a solution that will allow us to relax until a vaccine is created. What is required
            is a wholesale shift in how we understand and navigate the world - many of the unspoken rules that govern
            what is acceptable and what is possible no longer hold.
          </p>
          <p>
            By exploiting the interconnectedness of the world we live in, COVID 19 removes the luxury of thinking we are
            in control of our own lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a country like Australia, all the Government can do is impose more restrictions to force people to act in
            a certain way.
          </p>
          <p>
            It may seem as individuals that we have limited control over the spread of the virus. In the early stages of
            the infection at least, there is no way of knowing you are infected.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as the exponential charts earlier in this story show, one infected person can have a dramatic effect on
            numbers if they don't keep their social distance from the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            To overcome, we must learn to live in a world where we accept that we all hold the key to each other's
            safety… so wash your hands and stay home.

          <p>EXTRA BITS</p>
          <p>
            State governments are issuing fines, and checking in people in isolation, but as a democracy Australia
            doesn't have the tools of control and surveillance that allowed China to rapidly shut down and track its
            citizens, and so we will be relying on people to do their part.
          </p>
          <p>
            If everyone can effectively practise social distancing measures, like keeping a 1.5 metres from other
            people, working from home if they can, isolating themselves if they become sick, avoiding at risk
            populations, and practicing good hygiene then we can reduce the spread.
          </p>
          <p>
            The precipitous falls in restaurant and retail spending may reveal that we as a nation are taking this
            seriously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before the pandemic, the complexity of the modern world at once linked us and obscured the complicated
            interactions and supply chains that form those links, shielding us from the consequences of our actions. Now
            those links are laid bare in the desperate quest for tests and medical supplies, and the effects of our
            individual actions can be directly mapped in the spread of the virus.
